- The EC2PrimeDeployRole needs S3 permissions to facilitate seamless application deployments, configuration management, logging, and automated updates. Granting least privilege access ensures security while enabling necessary functionality.
  This role grants the EC2 instance permissions to access AWS services needed for deployment.
  It needs s3 permissions because CodeDeploy stores deployment artifacts in an S3 bucket before transfering the deployment artifacts to the EC2 instance.
